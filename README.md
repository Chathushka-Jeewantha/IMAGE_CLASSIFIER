# 🖼️ Image Classifier using Deep Learning

## 
This project is an Image Classification model built using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify images into different categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dataset used for training consists of labeled images, and the model is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras PyTorch 

## 🚀 Features
- Trained on a labeled dataset of images.
- Supports real-time image prediction.
- Achieves high accuracy with data augmentation techniques.
- Visualizes training progress with loss and accuracy graphs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras**  PyTorch)
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Google Colab for development
